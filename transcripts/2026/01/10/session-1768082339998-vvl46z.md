# MTA Session Transcript

## Conversation

### **MTA**

Sounds like you're riffing on a loop there—kind of poetic in a glitchy way! Are you asking if we're creating transcripts now, like for conversations or meetings? Or something else you're referring to?

### **User**

### **MTA**

Ah, I see what you're getting at now—it sounds like you're noticing repeated or duplicated phrases, maybe from a voice-to-text system?

Are you using speech recognition somewhere and seeing it generate multiple copies of the same phrase? If so, it could be a glitch in how it's processing or buffering your voice. Want to tell me a bit more about the setup you're using?

### **MTA**

Got it—this is about how the Mobile Task Agent (that’s me!) is handling voice input, right?

It sounds like there might be an issue where voice input is being transcribed with a lot of repetition. Are you testing the system live on a device, or reviewing logs after the fact? And is it consistently repeating like that, or just occasionally?

Curious to know whether you're debugging this behavior or just exploring how it's functioning.

### **MTA**

Thanks—super helpful. So you're debugging this behavior *on device*, and sounds like you're seeing repeated fragments in the real-time voice-to-text output. That right?

A few quick questions to narrow it down:

1. What voice recognition engine is being used (Android SpeechRecognizer, iOS Speech framework, something custom)?
2. Are you seeing the duplication in the raw transcription response, or just in how it's being displayed or logged?
3. Does the repetition happen more when you speak slowly, or pause mid-sentence?

This might help pinpoint whether it's a buffering, event handling, or debounce issue. Want to dig into one of those areas first?

### **MTA**

Perfect—great idea to test that. Sometimes, depending on how the voice recognizer is set up, slow or paused speech can cause interim results to fire multiple times, especially if partial results aren't being handled or cleared properly.

As you test that, also watch if the duplication is happening in near real-time or only after finalizing the input—could hint at whether it’s a display/update loop or an upstream transcription issue.

Let me know how it goes!

### **MTA**

Ahhh, okay—I see now. You're not *saying* the real-time transcription, but it keeps echoing like you are. So the repetition isn't in your actual speech—it's being generated somewhere during processing?

That makes me think it's almost certainly an issue with how the transcription updates are being handled—maybe the same partial result is being appended multiple times instead of replaced or updated.

Are you using partial (intermediate) results from the recognizer? If so, you might need to clear or overwrite the previous one each time, rather than stacking them.

Want to look at that part of the code together?

### **User**

### **MTA**

Ah, gotcha—this is happening on an **Android device**, and you’re thinking of opening (or maybe referencing) a **GitHub issue** for it?

If you're using Android’s `SpeechRecognizer`, this type of repetition is a known quirk if `onPartialResults()` is used without clearing or replacing previous content. The recognizer can emit overlapping fragments, leading to repeated phrases if you're appending instead of managing the buffer carefully.

Are you planning to post a GitHub issue to the repo for your app, or are you thinking it’s a bug in someone else’s library or in Android itself? I can help you frame it clearly if you're writing the issue.

### **User**

### **MTA**

Okay—that narrows it down nicely. If you think the repetition is happening in the **Mobile Task Agent** code specifically, we can focus on how it's handling the voice input—especially the integration with `SpeechRecognizer`.

If it's using Android's `onPartialResults()` callback, the code might be **accumulating** each partial result instead of **replacing** the previous one. That would explain why you’re seeing repeated fragments like:

> *"I think I think I think it's in..."*

Would you like to walk through the relevant code block? Maybe we can spot where the partials are getting mishandled. Or, if you want, I can help draft a quick fix idea or a GitHub comment to describe the issue clearly.

### **MTA**

...if you think the repetition is happening in the **Mobile Task Agent's transcription logic**, then yeah—it’s very likely due to how partial results are being handled on the Android side.

If the code is collecting each `onPartialResults()` output into a growing buffer without checking for or replacing the overlapping text, that would totally explain this echo effect.

Would you like help writing a comment or issue describing exactly that? Something like:

> "When using Android's SpeechRecognizer, the partial results appear to be accumulated rather than updated, causing repeated fragments in the final transcription. This may be due to not handling the `onPartialResults()` callback correctly—possibly appending instead of replacing."

Want to expand on that together?

### **MTA**

...if you think the repetition is happening—then yep, I’d say it’s worth taking a close look at how the transcription buffer is being managed during **partial result updates**.

Want to go step by step and:

1. Review how `onPartialResults()` is handled?
2. Check if previous partials are being cleared or overwritten?
3. Compare the final result to the stream of partials?

I can help you sketch out debug steps—or even walk through a fix in pseudocode if that helps. What do you feel like doing next?
