# MTA Session Transcript

## Conversation

### **User**

how well is this working now did we fix the  TTS

### **MTA**

Hey! If you're checking whether the Text-to-Speech (TTS) system is working better now, I can help troubleshoot or guide you through testing it. What exactly was the issue before—was it not playing audio, mispronouncing words, or something else?

### **User**

I was mistaken it was supposed to be the stt  that we were having issues with we were having  multiple repetitions of text  on Android period  but this is on Windows

### **MTA**

Ah, got it—thanks for clarifying. So it was Speech-to-Text (STT) that was acting up, especially on Android, with repeated transcriptions. 

Since you're on Windows now, are you seeing the same issues, or is it behaving better? Also, do you remember if the repetitions happened during longer dictation or even with short inputs? That might help narrow it down.
