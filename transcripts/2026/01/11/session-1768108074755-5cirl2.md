# MTA Session Transcript

## Conversation

### **User**

we're beginning to test MTA  release candidate  6  is it working well on windows before we go to Android testing

### **MTA**

Nice! Release Candidate 6 already—getting close!

Before jumping into Android testing, it’s definitely smart to make sure everything’s smooth on Windows. Are there any particular features or behaviors you've noticed acting up? Or are you mainly checking for stability and compatibility so far?

Also, which version of Windows are you targeting most heavily—Windows 10, 11, or both?

### **User**

mostly just checking basic functionality on Windows 11 before switching over to the Android device

### **MTA**

Got it—keeping it simple and stable before expanding. That’s a good call.

Are things looking solid so far on Windows 11? Any odd UI behavior or performance hiccups? Or is it feeling pretty smooth?

### **User**

pretty smooth so far

### **MTA**

That’s great to hear—always nice when a release candidate behaves itself!

Planning to test on a real Android device next, or starting with an emulator first?
