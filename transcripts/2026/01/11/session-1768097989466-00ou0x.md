### **MTA**

It sounds like you're asking: *"Are we having better luck with preventing duplications in...?"* Could you finish the sentence or specify what context you're referring to—like data entries, document management, genetic research, or something else entirely? I'd love to help clarify or find an answer with you!

### **MTA**

Ah, got it now — you're saying the problem has been with the **speech-to-text on mobile**, especially when it comes to **preventing duplications** like repeated words or phrases, right?

That’s definitely a common issue. Many mobile speech-to-text systems can misinterpret pauses, stutters, or emphasis as repeated words—especially if the connection is shaky or background noise is present.

Are you using a specific app or keyboard for speech-to-text (like Gboard, Apple's dictation, or something else)? Sometimes switching services or updating settings can help reduce those duplications.

### **MTA**

Ah, I see now — you're testing or reporting an issue **directly related to the MobileTask Agent’s** speech-to-text input. Thanks for clarifying!

So the duplication issue you're experiencing — like repeated words ("this this is this is...") — is happening when you're using voice input to interact with me, right?

That's super helpful to know. Do you remember if this happens:
- Every time you use voice input?
- Only with certain words or phrases?
- On a specific device or browser?

The more details you can share, the better we can work on improving it.
