### **MTA**

Sounds like we're kicking off testing for Release Candidate 6 of the Mobile Task Agent on Android—exciting times! 🎉

Is there anything specific you're looking to test, or are we doing a full regression sweep?

### **MTA**

Ah, got it—you're collecting data on an issue where speech-to-text is generating multiple repetitions of phrases. That definitely sounds like something worth digging into.

Do you know yet if it's specific to certain devices, OS versions, or apps? Or is it happening broadly across different scenarios?

### **MTA**

Absolutely, I’ve got you. Let’s walk through some steps to help isolate the issue on Android. We'll try to see if we can reproduce it consistently and narrow down the cause.

### 🧪 Step-by-Step Testing Plan:

#### 1. **Basic Device & App Info**
- What device model and Android version are you using?
- Which app is running the speech-to-text? Is it your own app or a third-party one like Google Voice Input?

#### 2. **Reproduction Steps**
Try this:
1. Open the app where speech-to-text is enabled.
2. Use the mic to say a short phrase (e.g. *"Testing speech to text"*).
3. Observe the output. Does it repeat words or phrases?
4. Repeat with different phrases and at different speaking speeds.

#### 3. **Environment Variables**
Let’s vary a few things to see what changes:
- Try with and without background noise.
- Test with Wi-Fi vs. mobile data.
- Try the same thing in a different app (like Google Keep or Notes).

#### 4. **Voice Input Settings**
- Head to **Settings > System > Languages & input > On-screen keyboard > Google Voice Typing**.
- Anything unusual in the settings? Try toggling off/on enhancements like voice personalization.

#### 5. **Log Review (if possible)**
If you can access logs:
- Check `logcat` for any errors or repeated recognizer events.
- Look for repeated `onPartialResults` or `onResults` callbacks (if you're using Android's SpeechRecognizer API).

We can go deeper depending on what you find. Want to try one of these now and report back what you see?

### **MTA**

Got it—this session is about generating transcripts *and* observing how the speech-to-text system behaves while doing so, especially around unwanted repetitions. Makes perfect sense.

Would you like me to help capture and structure the transcript from this session so far—including the repeated phrases? That might help with your analysis.

### **MTA**

Okay, great—you're looking for structured phrases that can help generate solid test data for analyzing speech-to-text repetition behavior. Let’s go with a few patterns that vary rhythm, complexity, and content so you can see where the system stumbles:

---

### 📋 **Test Phrase Patterns**

#### 🗣️ **1. Simple Repeatable Structure**
- “Testing one two three”
- “Alpha bravo charlie”
- “Apples bananas cherries”

#### 🧩 **2. Rhythmic / Alliterative**
- “Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers”
- “Sally sells sea shells by the sea shore”
- “Busy bees buzz by the blooming bushes”

#### 🌀 **3. Slight Variations**
- “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”
- “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”
- “The fast brown fox leapt over the sleepy dog”

#### 🔁 **4. Repetition Patterns**
- “Say it again say it again say it again”
- “Repeat repeat repeat”
- “One two one two one two”

#### ⚙️ **5. Command-Like**
- “Open the door and close the window”
- “Start the engine then stop the machine”
- “Turn left, turn right, walk forward, sit down”

You can speak these aloud at different speeds and tones, then check how the system handles each. Want more technical or domain-specific phrases too?
