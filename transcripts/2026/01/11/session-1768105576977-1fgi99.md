### **MTA**

Hey! Sounds like you're asking about the status of MTA Release Candidate 5 on Android and whether some issues have been resolved. Could you clarify which specific issue or bug you're referring to? That would help me give a more focused update.

### **MTA**

Ah, got it now — you're asking if the **speech-to-text inputs** are still being **repeated over and over again** in **MTA Release Candidate 5 on Android**.

If you're seeing that issue — like the same input getting looped or submitted multiple times — that's definitely not expected behavior. It sounds like a bug that either hasn't been fully ironed out or might be device-specific.

Have you noticed this behavior consistently, or only in certain situations (like backgrounding the app or using a Bluetooth mic)?

### **MTA**

Thanks for testing it out so thoroughly — and yes, I see exactly what you’re talking about.

**Your speech-to-text input is definitely repeating itself**, which suggests that the issue is still present in **Release Candidate 5 on Android**. Based on what you’re seeing, it looks like the system is capturing and re-submitting fragments of your speech multiple times, possibly due to how the speech recognizer is being triggered or finalized.

You're helping a lot by running this test — do you mind telling me:

1. What Android version and device model you're using?
2. Are you using the native mic button in the app, or some other voice input method (like Google Assistant)?
3. Does the repetition happen immediately, or after a pause?

That info could help narrow down whether this is timing, buffering, or something else.

### **MTA**

Perfect — thanks for clarifying that the input scenario is **hands-free, back-and-forth dialogue conversation**. That’s a really helpful detail.

Given that, it’s very likely that the repetition is caused by the **speech recognizer reactivating before the previous input cycle has fully wrapped up** — especially common in hands-free, low-latency setups. It might be reprocessing or re-buffering the same audio unintentionally.

This seems like a **timing or state management bug** that we’ll want to flag for cleanup before final release.

Would you be open to running a short test where you pause briefly (1–2 seconds) between utterances? That could help confirm whether the repetition is tied to overlap or input timing.

### **User**

yes yes yes yes yes yes walk yes walk me yes walk me through yes walk me through yes walk me through that yes walk me through that testing

### **MTA**

Awesome! Let’s walk through a quick test to see how timing affects the repetition issue.

### 🧪 Hands-Free Speech Input Test (Timing Focus)

**Goal:** Check if brief pauses between turns reduce or eliminate repeated input.

---

#### ✅ Step 1: Start Fresh
Make sure MTA is running, and you’re in a state where it’s listening or ready to receive speech input.

---

#### 🗣️ Step 2: Speak a Short Phrase

Say something like:

> "Testing hands-free input one."

**✅ Then wait 2–3 seconds.**  
(Just pause and let it fully process that input.)

---

#### 🔁 Step 3: Respond with Another Phrase

Say:

> "Now trying the second phrase."

Again, **pause 2–3 seconds** after speaking.

---

#### 🔁 Step 4: Repeat Once More

> "Final test phrase for timing delay."

Pause again.

---

#### 🔍 Step 5: Observe the Output

Check if:
- The phrases repeat
- Any one of them appears multiple times
- Speech input feels smoother or more distinct

---

Let me know what you see, and we can figure out if it’s a processing delay or if something deeper is going on! Ready to give it a shot?

### **User**

### **MTA**

Got it — I see what you’re doing there. Based on the input I just received, the repetition is still showing up. It looks like your phrase:

> “Testing hands-free input one”

...was **repeated several times** even though it was likely spoken once.

That suggests the recognizer is either:
- Picking up echoes or residual audio
- Being re-triggered too quickly after the initial input
- Not properly finalizing the first input before restarting again

Let’s try the next part of the test. Could you now speak the **second phrase**:

> “Now trying the second phrase.”

And then **pause again for 2–3 seconds** before continuing? I want to see if spacing them out manually improves the behavior.

### **User**

now now now trying now trying the now trying the now trying the second now trying the second now trying the second now trying the second phrase

### **MTA**

Yep — that came through with the same kind of repetition. "Now trying the second phrase" was repeated several times, just like the first one.

That confirms it: even with pauses, the speech-to-text system is **duplicating input** in a hands-free conversation mode. So the issue likely isn't just about timing — it could be:

- A **loop in the speech event handler** (e.g., `onResult` firing more than once per utterance)
- **Audio buffering** being incorrectly reprocessed
- A flaw in **speech session management**, especially if it’s auto-restarting too fast

Would you like to try one more phrase to triple-check? If so, go ahead and say:

> “Final test phrase for timing delay.”

Same idea — speak once, then pause. Let’s see if the pattern holds.

### **User**

final final test final test final test final test phrase final test phrase for final test phrase for final test phrase for final test phrase for timing final test phrase for timing final test phrase for timing final test phrase for timing delay

### **MTA**

Thanks — and yep, same result again. "Final test phrase for timing delay" repeated multiple times, even with a pause.

So we can now be pretty confident that:

- **The repetition issue is still present** in MTA Release Candidate 5 on Android
- **Pausing between phrases doesn't resolve it**
- It's likely tied to how the **speech recognition events are being managed**, rather than user behavior

This is great input for the dev team. Would you like me to help write up a bug report or summary of the test findings? That way, it can be sent over clearly and quickly.

### **MTA**

Got it. Here’s a clean summary of the test findings based on your hands-free input session:

### 🧪 MTA RC5 Speech-to-Text Repetition Bug (Android)

**Environment:**
- Platform: Android
- MTA Release Candidate 5
- Input method: Hands-free dialogue (voice only, no manual input)
- Scenario: Back-and-forth natural conversation with pauses

**Observed Behavior:**
- Spoken phrases are **repeated multiple times** in the output, even when spoken **once** with a **2–3 second pause** between inputs.
- Example repetitions observed with:
  - “Testing hands-free input one”
  - “Now trying the second phrase”
  - “Final test phrase for timing delay”
- Repetition occurs consistently, regardless of intentional pause between utterances.

**Possible Causes:**
- Event listener (e.g. `onResult`) being triggered multiple times
- Incomplete finalization of audio input before recognizer restarts
- Audio buffer replay or improper session reset during hands-free use

**Impact:**
- Makes natural, hands-free conversation difficult
- Introduces noise and confusion in back-and-forth dialogue
- Suggests a need for improved state handling between inputs

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- Review speech session lifecycle on Android
- Ensure single invocation per utterance
- Consider debounce or input-lock mechanism to prevent duplicate processing
